# NLP_DL_Workshop

In this workshop, we will be doing some hands-on leveraging pre-trained models using DL. 

## How to run:
All the setup is done within the notebook, to run this open with collab

## Notebook content:
1. 01_intro_to_transformer_models.ipynb:
 -- In this notebook we will be learning, how to use pre-trained pipelines provided by hugging face library!
2. 02_Fine_Tuning_Sentiment_Classification.ipynb:
 -- Next, We will be fine tuning DistilBert for Sentiment Classification dataset
3. 03_ner_fine_tuning.ipynb:
  -- We will do some final fine-tuning on NER Dataset

## Using Doccano:
Lastly, we'll learn about Docanno and how to annotate our own data using Docanno
 ** Note: To set up docann, use docanno labelling guide
