Or maybe his own memories, if this wasn't mind-altering, would go something like this:\n","\n","\"It was a few days ago, when he was with his friend, Darth Skywalker... after an old-timey moment when a kid in a wheelchair suddenly got hurt by another. They didn't know it yet, but they saw a man fall apart and try to wake up at the bottom of the mountain... and there was blood everywhere. So they just took him.

She was so young, and this was no accident. She had been a hero to someone. But this person, for all the reasons mentioned... that person had gone back to be a young woman in her own right. An elderly woman, a man with no real ties to the force and who was very much looking back at her on a daily basis. She had done things that are now more acceptable to her than ever. She had helped the Death Star destroy the planet Tatooine in order to do so, and there would be a chance that she would return after this, which might have led to a few others. She probably would have also found her place to work as an assassin.\n","\n","This \"real life\" would never have been possible, and for most of her life she had been a mere pawn in the galactic plot, and not even in her own right. That she was the one who brought the Death Star back from the dead is pretty much the only thing that matters. After all, it is the reason she was there for that first year.\n","\n","The entire time she was a hero to Skywalker, her father had been to Tatooine many times and they always showed up to make a point. This was a good thing; it meant that Skywalker had been to him many times and they always talked about the Star Wars films and the character of his father in particular. Even though Luke and Leia were in the movies when Lucas was writing the story, the Star Wars stories and the other stuff that followed were never mentioned or talked about.\n","\n","But he could always get the stories to happen, and he did.\n","\n","Because Leia, like her, had a much different path of travel, she had been to the beginning of the galaxy before. And for many years, she had been traveling in her own right, to some places without being known as it to others. In fact, most of the time it was Luke who was the one who wrote the script for the character of Luke Skywalker. He had gotten some stories for her to tell, and they all told very convincing stories.\n","\n","There were a few other movies for her to go to. One was A Midsummer Night's Dream where she would play one of Luke's most favorite companions. And of course he would ask her to play him like him.\n","\n","But before she did this, she was about to take off on a trip into space when something terrible happened. And suddenly she stopped.\n","\n","That thing had not always been that way. At some point, she almost died. It was only then that she realized the true purpose of her life was to find a way to get into some kind of higher plane of reality by helping Luke save his brother Luke. In a way, that would have been her life. So she tried... to have an adventure; try to help her brother go through something new.\n","\n","Well, she managed to get his fate in order. Luke would not survive the experience, and Leia would be in the dark.\n","\n","But a little bit back then, one day, in an effort to get at some sort of hope, a figure came knocking on her door that was asking for Leia's help in the matter of rescuing Luke. And the person she wanted Luke to rescue, even though he was just a prisoner for a time, wouldn't budge a peep... unless there was some sort of magic device in him, and the only hope he had was to use it to get past Luke's past, the one that made Luke feel bad about doing this, and then bring him out of this dark place that he knew he couldn't escape.\n","\n","And before she could get to her destination, it hit her head.
